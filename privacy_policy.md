# Privacy Policy for Font Changer

**Last Updated:** December 9, 2025

## Introduction
Font Changer ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your information.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, share, or sell any of your personal data.**

The Font Changer extension operates entirely locally on your device.
*   **No Tracking:** We do not track your browsing history or search queries.
*   **No Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics tools to monitor your usage.
*   **No User Accounts:** You do not need to create an account to use the extension.

## Permissions Usage
To function correctly, Font Changer requires specific browser permissions. Here is how and why we use them:

*   **`Host Permissions (<all_urls>)`**: We need access to check the content of web pages solely to inject CSS rules that change the font family. We do not read or transmit page content.
*   **`Storage`**: We use your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to save your font preferences (e.g., your "Recent Fonts" list). This data never leaves your device.
*   **`ActiveTab`**: We use this to detect when you interact with the extension popup on a specific tab.

## Third-Party Services
*   **Google Fonts**: This extension downloads font stylesheets and font files from the Google Fonts CDN (`fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com`). When your browser requests these resources, your IP address is visible to Google, subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We do not send any additional user data to Google.
